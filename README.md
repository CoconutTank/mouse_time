# mouse_time
This is the second game I've created in Godot, using what I've learned from their 2D game tutorial and trying out different features. I hope to add more to it! But it is at least playable now.

The new stuff that I learned from this game:
- Implementing mouse motion control.
- How to use awaits to delay logic properly (for displaying a message or countdown in sequence as an example).
- RigidBody2D is almost entirely phyics based, so moving it manually via position doesn't work.
- How to connect to a signal by code instead of editor (which is necessary when dealing with signals from instanced entities).
